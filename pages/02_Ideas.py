# Ideas
## Models
- Multinomial logit model
- Ordered probit model
- Particle filter
- Linear Kalman filter
- Unscented Kalman filter

## Study how horses move
- How fast do they run at each part of the race?
- If we built a model with no interaction how would this work?
- What are the flaws? What could go wrong with assuming no interaction which would impact the distribution of the outcome?

## Bet sizing
- How do you account for a fraction of the pool to already being taken?
