# What is handicapping in horseracing?
Handicapping is the process of adjusting a horse's speed using weights to make the outcome of the race more equal. If there was no handicapping, the same horse would always win and it would be boring.

Requires horses to jump over obstacles like fences and ditches. It primarily takes place in France, Great Britain, and Ireland during winter months when softer ground conditions make jumping safer for horses.
